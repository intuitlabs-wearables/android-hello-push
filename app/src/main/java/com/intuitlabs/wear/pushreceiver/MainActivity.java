/**
 * The main and only {@link android.app.Activity} in this demo app, has a textview, wrapped into a scroll container,
 * to show the plain payload of the notification, i.e. the JSON document.
 * <p>
 * In the activities onCreate handler, we register the user's device with the push notification services.
 * Therefore, we have the GCM Project number and the Intuit SenderID stored here. A better place
 * might be the Application class, if an app has/need one.
 * These two ids that identify the application at the push service, are used in the
 * {@link com.intuitlabs.wear.pushreceiver.GCMIntentService}, and therefore, if they get moved elsewhere,
 * the sourcecode of the service needs to be updated accordingly.
 * </p>
 * The GCMIntentService's static register method if called with an arbitrary id but it needs to be
 * unique among all users of this application. Providing group names is optional, but provides an
 * efficient way to send a single message to a group of users. Again, segmentation is arbitrary,
 * could be a geo. region, age-group, etc.
 * <p/>
 * To test this application, send the JSON document:
 * PushReceiver/app/src/androidTest/assets/notification.json,
 * together with your INTUIT_SENDER_ID and the user name "Donald Duck" using this web form:
 * http://wear.intuitlabs.com/getstarted/?page_id=1030
